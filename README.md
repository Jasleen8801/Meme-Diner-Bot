## Project Overview
One of the highlights of 2022 was having quality cooking and food memes to lean on for entertainment. Some memes this year were popular for their ability to perfectly convey a well-known truth by adding an element of comedy, while others were just relatable the way memes often are. A number of circulating memes made reference to popular television shows and celebrities. With all of the cooking show personalities who have become part of the larger culture, this comes as no surprise. Many food memes creatively took on culinary traditions, poking fun at holidays and even well-accepted kitchen ingredients a lot of us take for granted.
<br/><br/>
Here presenting to you the **Meme-Diner Bot** which shows you the best of food memes you ever saw and have you rolling on the bed.
